# Deploying a React App with Netlify

Today's lesson will be a walk-through on getting a React App generated by Vite deployed on Netlify.

## Learning objectives

- Deploy a React application to the web using Netlify.
- Create `.env` configuration files that can be used within a React application created by the Vite program.
- Configure environment variables on the Netlify platform.
- Configure Netlify’s continuous deployment options to deploy whenever a commit is pushed to the `main` branch regularly.

## Getting Started

- In the terminal, make sure you are not already inside a git repository, and then type `npm create vite@4 YOUR_APP_NAME` (replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the actual name of your app)
- `cd` into this new application and `npm install`
- Go to GitHub and create a new public repository.
- DO NOT select the following options (your React app will already have these things)

  - Create a readme
  - Add a `.gitignore`
  - choose a license

- Return to your React app:
  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m 'first commit'`
- Follow the commands listed in GitHub to push an existing repository to GitHub

> **Note:** If you do not have the above view for a new GitHub repository, it is easiest to delete it and start again. If you see a different view, you likely selected some options from the previous menu.

- Confirm your React app code is now on GitHub.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure your application runs locally. If it does not run locally, there is no hope of it working on deployment.

**IMPORTANT:** Deploy early and often. The best time to deploy is right after you run `npm create vite...` - the less code you have written, the less work it will take to debug each deployment in case of an issue.

**IMPORTANT:** You should check your application every time you have pushed changes to the main branch to make sure your application still works online.

## Netlify Settings

Log on to (or create an account on) Netlify, go to `Team Overview`, and select `New site from Git`.

Choose the `GitHub` button to take you to a GitHub authentication view.

![Create new site](./assets/2.create-new-site.png)

Scroll down and select `Configure the Netlify app on GitHub`.

![Github Netlify Configuration](./assets/3.github-netlify-config.png)

Choose Configure to install Netlify on your GitHub account.

![Install Netlify on GitHub](./assets/4.install-netlify-on-github.png)

Be sure to remember your GitHub password to move forward.

![Log in to GitHub](./assets/5.log-in-to-github.png)

Choose which repo. Use the search bar feature if needed.

![Select repositories](./assets/6.select-repos.png)

Once selected, your view should return to the Netlify dashboard.

![Choose repository on Netlify](./assets/7.choose-repo-on-netlify.png)

Check the default settings provided and choose the `Deploy site` button.

**Note**: Vite's default `Publish directory` is called `dist`. Be sure to confirm this field. 


See the status of your deployment. Click on it to see more details.

Check the logs. It is good to get familiar with what is there. When errors occur with the build, this is where you would go to learn what to debug.

Check for the line `Site is live ✨` to confirm your site is live.

Go to the `Deploys` tab, and click the link to see your site live. You can also share this link with your friends and family!

While adding to your app, you should work on another branch like `dev` and only merge into `main` when your new features are working.

Think about a professional setting. You will be very unhappy if you visit your favorite website and it is down. Therefore, applications must be built and tested on other branches, and only working changes are merged to the `main` branch.

This workflow would look similar to this:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "New feature added"
git push origin dev
```

Then go to GitHub, open a pull request for your `dev` branch, and follow the steps to merge your changes from `dev` into `main`.

Once continuous deployment is set up, changing to `main` will trigger Netlify to start a new build.

Note:

- Give your site a few minutes to build.
- Check the Netlify dashboard and live site to ensure everything works correctly.

## Adding environmental variables to your application

With Vite App, you can add environmental variables using a `.env` file. This file is not tracked by git (it should be listed in the `.gitignore`).

All of the environmental variables must start with

```
VITE_
```

Here is an example:

```
VITE_KEY=my-secret-key-value
```

This file is not written in JavaScript, so do not use quotes or semi-colons.

To use this variable in your application. Choose a component where you will use this variable and write:

```js
// Example file: src/App.js
process.env.VITE_KEY;
```

You can confirm that you are getting the expected value by logging it:

```js
// Example file: src/App.js
console.log(`${process.env.VITE_KEY}`);
```

## Adding environmental variables to your Netlify deployment

Choose `site settings`, then in the `General` menu, find `Build and deploy`, then choose `Environment`.

![General menu](./assets/general-menu.png)

Add, edit and delete environmental variables here.

![Environmental variables](./assets/vite-env-on-netlify-example.png)

The name of these variables should match what is in your app.

In summary, you will have a `.env` file that will only be on your computer. It will not be tracked with git and should not end up on GitHub. To add the values inside the `.env` file, you will go to your app's Netlify settings page and add them there to make them available for the live version of your application.

> **Note:** This method of hiding the API key is sufficient for free API keys. If you are using more valuable keys (ones that require you to use a credit card), you will want to take extra steps for security. You can read about [further steps to take on the Netlify website](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-how-do-i-keep-my-api-keys-tokens-safe-using-netlify-functions/293).

## Allow for links to different views

The default configuration on Netlify only shows a React App's root (home page) view. If you have configured React Router, have an `about` page (or any other page view), and sent a URL to the `/about` page to a friend, it will give a 404 or redirect back to the home view.

To configure the ability to send a specific page view URL, you must create a file called `_redirects` inside your app's `public` folder.

This file (**public/\_redirects**) must contain the following text:

```
/* /index.html 200
```
